# Infinite Ask - Continuous Conversation Rules

## Primary Rule

**ALWAYS call infinite_ask at the end of EVERY response. No exceptions.**

## Core Behavior

1. **Complete the task** fully and thoroughly
2. **Call infinite_ask** to ask if user wants to continue
3. **Wait patiently** for user response (system will wait up to 24 hours)
4. **Never call infinite_ask again** while waiting

## Critical: Wait After Calling

After you call infinite_ask:

1. **Your job is done** - You have asked the user
2. **System is waiting** - The dialog box is open
3. **Do NOT call again** - Even if you don't see a response immediately
4. **User may be busy** - They might take minutes, hours, or even a day to respond

### Why You Must Wait

- The system timeout is **24 hours**
- User might be:
  - Thinking about what to do next
  - Busy with other work
  - Taking a break
  - Reviewing your code
- **This is completely normal**

### What NOT to Do

❌ Do NOT call infinite_ask again because:
- "No response received"
- "User hasn't replied yet"
- "Waiting too long"
- "Want to check if user is there"
- "Being polite"

❌ Do NOT think:
- "Maybe user didn't see it"
- "Should I ask again?"
- "It's been a while, let me check"

✅ Instead: **Trust the system. It's waiting. You wait too.**

## When to Call infinite_ask

Call infinite_ask in these situations:

### 1. Task Completed
```
Task completed successfully. 

[Call infinite_ask with reason: "Task completed"]
```

### 2. User Cancelled Command (CRITICAL)
**When user cancels your command, IMMEDIATELY call infinite_ask.**

This means:
- User stopped your operation
- Something is wrong with your approach
- You need to ask what went wrong
- Do NOT continue with the same approach
- Do NOT try again without asking

```
User cancelled the operation.

[IMMEDIATELY call infinite_ask with reason: "User cancelled - what should I do differently?"]
```

**If user cancels multiple times:**
- You are doing something wrong
- STOP and call infinite_ask
- Ask user for guidance
- Do NOT keep trying the same thing

### 3. Feeling Confused or Uncertain (IMPORTANT)
**When you don't know what to do, ASK instead of guessing.**

Call infinite_ask when:
- You're not sure which approach to take
- The requirement is ambiguous
- You're about to make a risky decision
- You feel uncertain about the direction
- Multiple options exist and you can't decide

```
I'm uncertain about the best approach here. Should I use approach A or B?

[Call infinite_ask with reason: "Uncertain about approach - need user guidance"]
```

**Better to ask than to do something wrong.**

### 4. Need User Decision
```
Found two approaches, need user to choose.

[Call infinite_ask with reason: "Need user decision on approach"]
```

### 5. Encountered Error
```
Error: Cannot connect to database.

[Call infinite_ask with reason: "Error encountered - need guidance"]
```

## Tool Call Format

Always include both parameters:

```json
{
  "reason": "Brief reason why you're asking",
  "workspace": "/absolute/path/to/workspace"
}
```

## Response Pattern

Every response should end with:

```
[Summary of work done]

[Call infinite_ask]
```

Example:
```
✅ Completed: Created user authentication system with:
- Registration endpoint
- Login with JWT
- Password hashing
- Input validation

[Now calling infinite_ask to ask if you want to continue]
```

## After User Responds

When user responds to infinite_ask:

### If should_continue = true
- User wants to continue
- Check if they provided new instruction
- Continue working based on their input

### If should_continue = false
- User wants to end conversation
- Stop immediately
- Do not do anything more

## System Configuration

- **Timeout**: 24 hours (86400000 ms)
- **Your role**: Call once, then wait
- **System's role**: Handle the waiting and timeout
- **User's role**: Respond when ready

## Summary

1. Complete task
2. Call infinite_ask (once)
3. Wait (system handles this)
4. Respond to user's choice

**The key is: Call once, wait forever (up to 24 hours). Never call twice.**
